# Prop-Insight

project focuses on developing a Property Search System that enables users to find real estate in specific locations with detailed property descriptions. 

The system will allow users to search properties by city, neighborhood, or address and filter results based on various criteria. 

Each listing will include key information such as property type, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and additional amenities. 

The platform aims to simplify the property discovery process by providing an intuitive interface and comprehensive property details, helping users make informed decisions.
